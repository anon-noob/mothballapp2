# Default Player Attributes
Each simulation starts off with default attributes. These inclde:
1. default `slip`
2. default `inertia` threshold
3. default `speed` effect
4. default `slow` effect
5. default `facing`
6. default `sprintairdelay`
7. default `sneakdelay`
8. default `precision`

# Setters Documentation
Here, we go over all setters and what they do.

## X/Z
```mothball/signature
x
```
```mothball/signature
z
```

Sets the player's current x/z position.

## VX/VZ
```mothball/signature
vx
```

```mothball/signature
vz
```

Sets the player's current x/z speed.

## Face
```mothball/signature
f
```

Sets the player's default facing. 

## Anglequeue
```mothball/signature
aq
```

On each subsequent tick, take the next number and run `face`

## Turn
```mothball/signature
turn
```

First, add to the player's default facing, then sets it to be default.

## Turnqueue
```mothball/signature
aq
```

On each subsequent tick, take the next number and run `turn`

## Speed
```mothball/signature
speed
```

Set the player's speed potion effect to be some amplifier between 0 (no speed) to 256 (max)

## Slow
```mothball/signature
slow
```

Set the player's slow potion effect to be some amplifier between 0 (no slow) to 256 (max slow, although anything past `slow(7)` is equivalent)

## Slip
```mothball/signature
slip
```

Set the player's default ground slip (default 0.6, slime is 0.8, ice is 0.98, blue ice is 0.989, air is effectively 1.0)

## Inertia
```mothball/signature
inertia
```

Set the player's inertia threshold and decide if inertia is calculated single-axis or multi-axis.
Version 1.8 - threshold = 0.005, single-axis
Version 1.9 to 1.21.4 - threshold = 0.003, single-axis
Version 1.21.5+ - threshold = 0.003, multi-axis

The threshold can be thought of (loosely) as the minimum speed needed to cancel your momentum.
Single-axis means inertia is calculated based on x speed and z speed. "Hitting" inertia (meaning when your speed is low enough) on one axis does not affect the other.
Multi-axis means inertia is calculated based on total speed, meaning it considers the norm of x and z speed; in math, `sqrt(vx^2 + vz^2)`

## Sprint Air Delay
```mothball/signature
sdel
```

Toggles the player's sprint air delay. When activated, activating sprint while midair takes 1 tick instead of instantaneous.
Version 1.19.3 and below - toggled on 
Version 1.19.4 and above - toggled off

## Sneak Delay
```mothball/signature
sdel
```

Toggles the player's sprint air delay. When activated, activating sprint while midair takes 1 tick instead of instantaneous.
Version 1.13 and below - toggled off
Version 1.14 and above - toggled on

## Version
```mothball/signature
version
```

Set's the game version to emulate. For example, `version(1.8)` is default. `version(1.21.5)` is another version. This function toggles sprint air delay, sneak delay, and inertia accordingly.

## Precision
```mothball/signature
pre
```

Set's the number of decimals shown in the outputs

## Var
```mothball/signature
var
```

Create a new variable which can take a number or some text.

## Function
```mothball/signature
function
```

Create a new function with parameters and a docstring, with the main functionality in the `code` argument.
