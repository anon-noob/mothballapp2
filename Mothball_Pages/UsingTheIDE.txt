# How to Use the IDE
The IDE functions similarly to a coding notebook. The IDE has code cells. In each cell is where you type Mothball code. Click the `Run` button to run the code. The output will be shown below. You can also press `Ctrl R` to run the code.

This IDE also comes with syntax highlighting. As you type, it will color code the code you're writing.

## Two Kinds of cells
To create a new "xz" cell, click on the `Add Cell XZ` button. To create a new "y" cell, click on the `Add Cell Y` button. The difference is whether you want to perform horizontal movement calculations (xz), or vertical movement calculations (y).

## Deleting cells
Click the `Delete` button to delete the cell. As of right now, if you delete it, it is final and is not undoable.

## Changing the Cell's Title
You can double click on the cell's title to change it.

## Resizing the IDE
Press `Ctrl +`/`Ctrl -` to increase/decrease the font size respectively.

Resizing the window will cause the cells to resize as well.

## Top Menu
On the top left corner is the `File` menu. This is where you can load, save, and make new notebooks.

Next to it is `Options`, which is where you can customize settings, especially the color code.

Next to it is `Help`. You clicked on it to be able to see this documentation!

Lastly, the `Update` menu shows the last changelog and checks if there's a new version available. As of right now, you have to manually download the new version to update it.
