[update info here]
for now, see the mothball or mothballapp repo for info.

Download the appropiate executable for your operating system. If you encountered an error and you previously used much older versions of Mothball, annoy @anonnoob. Usually this can be fixed by deleting your Mothball appdata. Find it on...
-  Windows: `.../usr/Appdata/Roaming/Mothball`
-  MacOS: `.../usr/Library/Application Support/Mothball`
-  Linux: `.../usr/.config/Mothball`

As of right now, linux may encounter problems depending on the distro, namely gtk-based.
