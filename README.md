[update info here (I AM LAZY)]
for now, see the mothball or mothballapp repo for more info.

Mothball is a minecraft parkour calculator. That is literally it. Tell it what movement you want to do, and it outputs the relevant position and velocity (or whatever other things you want).

### Is a 5 block jump possible?

and many more things you can do.

> [! NOTE]
> Currently calculations are float accurate in minecraft versions 1.8-1.13, and on average e-8 accurate in versions 1.14+. For most if not almost all applications, this differernce is negligible. If you are using this to create strategies intended for a human to do, then one does not necessarily need anything more precise than e-6/e-7 precision. Float accuracy for 1.14+ is currently in the making. 

Download the appropiate executable for your operating system. If you encountered an error and you previously used much older versions of Mothball, annoy @anonnoob. Usually this can be fixed by deleting your Mothball appdata. Find it on...
-  Windows: `.../usr/Appdata/Roaming/Mothball`
-  MacOS: `.../usr/Library/Application Support/Mothball`
-  Linux: `.../usr/.config/Mothball`

As of right now, linux may encounter problems depending on the distro, namely gtk-based.
